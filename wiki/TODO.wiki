= Introduction =

The work will be divided among group members by application kernel:
 * BT -> V.V.
 * LU -> B.K.
 * SP -> P.N.


= Details =

For each kernel, we will first:
 * ~~Benchmark OMP-Fortran vs OMP-C~~
 * ~~Determine most expensive functions in each kernel using profiling tools~~
 * ~~Convert one-dimensional algorithm seen in shared memory version to distributed memory~~
 * Profile one-dimensional distributed version -- Partially Completed
 * Tune and optimize
 * Compare to automatically generated MPI codes
