== Block-Tridiagonal Solver ==

The BT  benchmark solves multiple, independent systems of non diagonally dominant block of tridiagonal equations with a 5 by 5 block size. The benchmark requires square numbers of processors, but they can handle other numbers as well


= Details =

Per our initial benchmarks, we found that the most time consuming portion of the code is the `binvcrhs()` function which consumes approximately 29% of the total runtime
